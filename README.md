This is the ReadMe for cpst342f17hw2.
The extra credit I completed is as follows:
 - Imported Google Fonts
 - Used a stack font
 - Page is responsive (although i didn't use media queries??)
 - HTML is fully-semantic (a div is used w/in a semantic, from the lecture I believe this okay.)

 In my experience, there are pros and cons to using my own grid versus using Bootstrap. I really like Bootstrap, in that it works out the box. You can add a script and voila, your site is responsive. And if you work on WordPress often, this is a great tool, because you can focus on other aspects without spending too much time on the responsive aspect, since most themes now incorporate Bootstap. Bootstrap is also cross-browser friendly, whereas CSS grids have just become so, which could have caused more work than should've been needed, just to be compatible with all browsers.

However, with that said, I find that using my own grid saves me time. That may seem contradictory to what I said above, but going back to WordPress, where even if you create a child-theme to create original code, you may find that changing some things that are seemingly simple, taking you much more time, because you have to work within a one size fits all framework.

For me, if I'm working on one of my own projects, I like to start fresh with the blankslate theme if in WP or from scratch if not. If I'm creating a site for a third-party, Bootstrap allows for the project to be handed over seemlessly and for them to do any ongoing updates. Although I almost always have original styling or components that I add, and of course the client doesn't always realize the work that went into making the customizations fit into an existing theme.

In short, control freaks may find that grids are better than Bootstrap.
